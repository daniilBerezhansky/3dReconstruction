# Requirements

## 1. PURPOSE
The goal of this project is to provide mobile application which reconstruct the 3D model of an object from multiple images of it.

## 2. SCOPE
"Application Name" is a mobile application for 3D reconstruction. User should provide multiple images from a different perspective with some object on it. These images will be sent to a server, which will incoming images and will return the 3D model of the particular object.

## 3. PRODUCT PERSPECTIVE
The mobile application requires Internet onnection to send images and recieve the 3D model. Reconstruction from images is carried out on a web-server.

  ### 3.1  USER INTERFACES
A first-time user of the mobile application should see the log-in. If the user has not registered, he/she should be able to do that on the log-in page. If the user is not a first-time user, he/she should be able to see a dialog which helps to sent data to the server. If the user has receieved the 3D model or he/she has it from the previous session, the user should be able to open the window through which the user can interact with the 3D model.
